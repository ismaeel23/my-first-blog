        <p class="card-text3">My name is Ismaeel Aziz and I am a first year Computer Science student transitioning into the second year at the University of Birmingham. The aim of my blogging website is  to provide prospective computer science students with an insight on what to expect when studying this degree, and to outline my experience. Throughout my time at the University of Birmingham, I am enjoying learning and enhancing my current knowledge and expertise further within my course and adding onto my computer science experience. I created this web application using the Django web framework, GitHub to allow version control and managing of my code, and PythonAnywhere to host the application. In my spare time I enjoy playing Snooker and going to the gym/boxing training. I am an aspiring Software Developer and Engineer for the automotive/automobile industry. Working on cars/enjoying them has always been an interest to me, and getting into ECU remapping and experimenting with my own carâ€™s software has further sparked an interest for me to get into software engineering within the automotive industry as cars are becoming more driven by software over mechanics. I am excited about what the future holds for me at the University of Birmingham and in the Software Engineering industry. I hope this blogging page provides the support that prospective students or current Computer Science students may require.</p>
